# A TALE OF TWO VALUES

Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders: behavior and structure.

## Behavior
The first value of software is its behavior. Programmers write code to satisfy requirements of stakeholders and fix any bugs.
However this should not be their only job.

## Architecture
The more this architecture prefers one shape
over another, the more likely new features will be harder and harder to fit into that structure.
Therefore architectures should be as shape agnostic are practical.

## The greater value

Which is more important? behavior or architecture?
Is it more important for the
software system to work, or is it more important for the software system to be easy to change?

It might seem it's very important for the software to work but if it's impossible to change what value would it be if we want to update it ?
